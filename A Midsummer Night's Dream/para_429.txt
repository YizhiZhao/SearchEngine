THESEUS :  The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.  Pyramus  No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me' is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes. Enter Thisbe  Thisbe  O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans, For parting my fair Pyramus and me! My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones, Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.  Pyramus  I see a voice: now will I to the chink, To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!  Thisbe  My love thou art, my love I think.  Pyramus  Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace; And, like Limander, am I trusty still.  Thisbe  And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.  Pyramus  Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.  Thisbe  As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.  Pyramus  O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!  Thisbe  I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.  Pyramus  Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?  Thisbe  'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay. Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe  Wall  Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so; And, being done, thus Wall away doth go. Exit
