NORTHUMBERLAND :  Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind As with the tide swell'd up unto his height, That makes a still-stand, running neither way: Fain would I go to meet the archbishop, But many thousand reasons hold me back. I will resolve for Scotland: there am I, Till time and vantage crave my company. Exeunt  SCENE IV. London. The Boar's-head Tavern in Eastcheap.  Enter two Drawers  First Drawer  What the devil hast thou brought there? apple-johns? thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.  Second Drawer  Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dish of apple-johns before him, and told him there were five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said 'I will now take my leave of these six dry, round, old, withered knights.' It angered him to the heart: but he hath forgot that.  First Drawer  Why, then, cover, and set them down: and see if thou canst find out Sneak's noise; Mistress Tearsheet would fain hear some music. Dispatch: the room where they supped is too hot; they'll come in straight.  Second Drawer  Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master Poins anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons; and Sir John must not know of it: Bardolph hath brought word.  First Drawer  By the mass, here will be old Utis: it will be an excellent stratagem.  Second Drawer  I'll see if I can find out Sneak. Exit Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET
