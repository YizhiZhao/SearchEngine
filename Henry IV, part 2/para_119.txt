FALSTAFF :  My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without reply. You call honourable boldness impudent sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers, being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs. Lord Chief-Justice	You speak as having power to do wrong: but answer in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this poor woman.
