HENRY BOLINGBROKE :  Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.  Lord Marshal  Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.  First Herald  Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby, Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself, On pain to be found false and recreant, To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray, A traitor to his God, his king and him; And dares him to set forward to the fight.  Second Herald  Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, On pain to be found false and recreant, Both to defend himself and to approve Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby, To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal; Courageously and with a free desire Attending but the signal to begin.  Lord Marshal  Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants. A charge sounded Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.
