DUKE OF YORK :  He was? Why, so! go all which way it will! The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold, And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side. Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester; Bid her send me presently a thousand pound: Hold, take my ring.  Servant  My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship, To-day, as I came by, I called there; But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
