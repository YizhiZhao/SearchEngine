DUKE OF YORK :  It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause; For I am loath to break our country's laws. Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are: Things past redress are now with me past care. Exeunt  SCENE IV. A camp in Wales.  Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain  Captain  My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days, And hardly kept our countrymen together, And yet we hear no tidings from the king; Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.
