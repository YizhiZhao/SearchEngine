HENRY BOLINGBROKE :  Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand, And bow my knee before his majesty: For Mowbray and myself are like two men That vow a long and weary pilgrimage; Then let us take a ceremonious leave And loving farewell of our several friends.  Lord Marshal  The appellant in all duty greets your highness, And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
