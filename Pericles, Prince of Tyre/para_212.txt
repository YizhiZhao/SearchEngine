CERIMON :  Gentlemen, Why do you stir so early?  First Gentleman  Sir, Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea, Shook as the earth did quake; The very principals did seem to rend, And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear Made me to quit the house.  Second Gentleman  That is the cause we trouble you so early; 'Tis not our husbandry.
