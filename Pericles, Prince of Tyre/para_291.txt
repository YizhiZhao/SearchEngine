BOULT :  Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we should lodge them with this sign.  Bawd  [To MARINA]  Pray you, come hither awhile. You have fortunes coming upon you.

To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.
