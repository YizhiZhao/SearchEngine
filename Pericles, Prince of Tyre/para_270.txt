LEONINE :  These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes; And they have seized Marina. Let her go: There's no hope she will return. I'll swear she's dead, And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further: Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her, Not carry her aboard. If she remain, Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain. Exit  SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.  Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT  Pandar  Boult!
