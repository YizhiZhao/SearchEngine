SIMONIDES :  A pretty moral; From the dejected state wherein he is, He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.  First Lord  He had need mean better than his outward show Can any way speak in his just commend; For by his rusty outside he appears To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.  Second Lord  He well may be a stranger, for he comes To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.  Third Lord  And on set purpose let his armour rust Until this day, to scour it in the dust.
