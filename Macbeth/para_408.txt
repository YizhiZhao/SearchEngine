ACT V : SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.  Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman  Doctor  I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?  Gentlewoman  Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.  Doctor  A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?  Gentlewoman  That, sir, which I will not report after her.  Doctor  You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.  Gentlewoman  Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to confirm my speech. Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.  Doctor  How came she by that light?  Gentlewoman  Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; 'tis her command.  Doctor  You see, her eyes are open.  Gentlewoman  Ay, but their sense is shut.  Doctor  What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.  Gentlewoman  It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands: I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
