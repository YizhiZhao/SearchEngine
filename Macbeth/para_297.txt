MACBETH :  I conjure you, by that which you profess, Howe'er you come to know it, answer me: Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches; though the yesty waves Confound and swallow navigation up; Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down; Though castles topple on their warders' heads; Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure Of nature's germens tumble all together, Even till destruction sicken; answer me To what I ask you.  First Witch  Speak.  Second Witch  Demand.  Third Witch  We'll answer.  First Witch  Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths, Or from our masters?
