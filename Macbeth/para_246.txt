MACBETH :  Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect, Whole as the marble, founded as the rock, As broad and general as the casing air: But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?  First Murderer  Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides, With twenty trenched gashes on his head; The least a death to nature.
