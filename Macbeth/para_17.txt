DUNCAN :  What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won. Exeunt  SCENE III. A heath near Forres.  Thunder. Enter the three Witches  First Witch  Where hast thou been, sister?  Second Witch  Killing swine.  Third Witch  Sister, where thou?  First Witch  A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap, And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:-- 'Give me,' quoth I: 'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries. Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger: But in a sieve I'll thither sail, And, like a rat without a tail, I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.  Second Witch  I'll give thee a wind.  First Witch  Thou'rt kind.  Third Witch  And I another.  First Witch  I myself have all the other, And the very ports they blow, All the quarters that they know I' the shipman's card. I will drain him dry as hay: Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his pent-house lid; He shall live a man forbid: Weary se'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle, peak and pine: Though his bark cannot be lost, Yet it shall be tempest-tost. Look what I have.  Second Witch  Show me, show me.  First Witch  Here I have a pilot's thumb, Wreck'd as homeward he did come. Drum within  Third Witch  A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come.
