MACBETH :  Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day; And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood: Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; While night's black agents to their preys do rouse. Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still; Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill. So, prithee, go with me. Exeunt  SCENE III. A park near the palace.  Enter three Murderers  First Murderer  But who did bid thee join with us?  Third Murderer  Macbeth.  Second Murderer  He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just.  First Murderer  Then stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day: Now spurs the lated traveller apace To gain the timely inn; and near approaches The subject of our watch.  Third Murderer  Hark! I hear horses.
