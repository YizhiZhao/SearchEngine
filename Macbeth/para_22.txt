BANQUO :  Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth, Are ye fantastical, or that indeed Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope, That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not. If you can look into the seeds of time, And say which grain will grow and which will not, Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear Your favours nor your hate.  First Witch  Hail!  Second Witch  Hail!  Third Witch  Hail!  First Witch  Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.  Second Witch  Not so happy, yet much happier.  Third Witch  Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none: So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!  First Witch  Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
