ANGELO :  Even just the sum that I do owe to you Is growing to me by Antipholus, And in the instant that I met with you He had of me a chain: at five o'clock I shall receive the money for the same. Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, I will discharge my bond and thank you too. Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's  Officer  That labour may you save: see where he comes.
