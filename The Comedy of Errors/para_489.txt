DROMIO OF SYRACUSE :  Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, A nut, a cherry-stone; But she, more covetous, would have a chain. Master, be wise: an if you give it her, The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.  Courtezan  I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain: I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
