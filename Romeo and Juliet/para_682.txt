PAGE :  This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.  First Watchman  The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard: Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach. Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain, And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, Who here hath lain these two days buried. Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets: Raise up the Montagues: some others search: We see the ground whereon these woes do lie; But the true ground of all these piteous woes We cannot without circumstance descry. Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR  Second Watchman  Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.  First Watchman  Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither. Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE  Third Watchman  Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps: We took this mattock and this spade from him, As he was coming from this churchyard side.  First Watchman  A great suspicion: stay the friar too. Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
