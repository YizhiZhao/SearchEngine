FRIAR LAURENCE :  Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave: The heavens do lour upon you for some ill; Move them no more by crossing their high will. Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE  First Musician  Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.  Nurse  Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up; For, well you know, this is a pitiful case. Exit  First Musician  Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended. Enter PETER
