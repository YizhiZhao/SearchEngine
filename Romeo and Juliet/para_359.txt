JULIET :  No, no: but all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?  Nurse  Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces. My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back! Beshrew your heart for sending me about, To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
