FLAVIUS :  It is in vain that you would speak with Timon; For he is set so only to himself That nothing but himself which looks like man Is friendly with him.  First Senator  Bring us to his cave: It is our part and promise to the Athenians To speak with Timon.  Second Senator  At all times alike Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand, Offering the fortunes of his former days, The former man may make him. Bring us to him, And chance it as it may.
