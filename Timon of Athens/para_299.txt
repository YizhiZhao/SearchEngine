FLAVIUS :  Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you? Let me be recorded by the righteous gods, I am as poor as you.  First Servant  Such a house broke! So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not One friend to take his fortune by the arm, And go along with him!  Second Servant  As we do turn our backs From our companion thrown into his grave, So his familiars to his buried fortunes Slink all away, leave their false vows with him, Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self, A dedicated beggar to the air, With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty, Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows. Enter other Servants
