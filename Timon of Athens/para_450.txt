TIMON :  [Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.  Poet  Nay, let's seek him: Then do we sin against our own estate, When we may profit meet, and come too late.  Painter  True; When the day serves, before black-corner'd night, Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.
