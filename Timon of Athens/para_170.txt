APEMANTUS :  Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be no less esteemed. Varro's Servant	What is a whoremaster, fool?  Fool  A fool in good clothes, and something like thee. 'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord; sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher, with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is very often like a knight; and, generally, in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen, this spirit walks in. Varro's Servant	Thou art not altogether a fool.  Fool  Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as I have, so much wit thou lackest.
