SUFFOLK :  Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can, That this my death may never be forgot! Great men oft die by vile bezonians: A Roman sworder and banditto slave Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates. Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk  Captain  And as for these whose ransom we have set, It is our pleasure one of them depart; Therefore come you with us and let him go. Exeunt all but the First Gentleman Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body
