POSTHUMUS LEONATUS :  Still going? Exit Lord This is a lord! O noble misery, To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me! To-day how many would have given their honours To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't, And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd, Could not find death where I did hear him groan, Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster, 'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds, Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him For being now a favourer to the Briton, No more a Briton, I have resumed again The part I came in: fight I will no more, But yield me to the veriest hind that shall Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is Here made by the Roman; great the answer be Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death; On either side I come to spend my breath; Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again, But end it by some means for Imogen. Enter two British Captains and Soldiers  First Captain  Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken. 'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.  Second Captain  There was a fourth man, in a silly habit, That gave the affront with them.  First Captain  So 'tis reported: But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
