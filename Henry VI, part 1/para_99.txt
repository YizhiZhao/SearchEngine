OF WINCHESTER :  Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head; For I intend to have it ere long. Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF WINCHESTER with their Serving-men  Mayor  See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart. Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear! I myself fight not once in forty year. Exeunt  SCENE IV. Orleans.  Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy   Master-Gunner	Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged, And how the English have the suburbs won.  Boy  Father, I know; and oft have shot at them, Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim. Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me: Chief master-gunner am I of this town; Something I must do to procure me grace. The prince's espials have informed me How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd, Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars In yonder tower, to overpeer the city, And thence discover how with most advantage They may vex us with shot, or with assault. To intercept this inconvenience, A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed; And even these three days have I watch'd, If I could see them. Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer. If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word; And thou shalt find me at the governor's. Exit  Boy  Father, I warrant you; take you no care; I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them. Exit Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT, GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others
