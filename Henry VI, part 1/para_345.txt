JOAN LA PUCELLE :  These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen, Through which our policy must make a breach: Take heed, be wary how you place your words; Talk like the vulgar sort of market men That come to gather money for their corn. If we have entrance, as I hope we shall, And that we find the slothful watch but weak, I'll by a sign give notice to our friends, That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.  First Soldier  Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city, And we be lords and rulers over Rouen; Therefore we'll knock. Knocks  Watch  [Within]  Qui est la?
