YORK :  Are not the speedy scouts return'd again, That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin?  Messenger  They are return'd, my lord, and give it out That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power, To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along, By your espials were discovered Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led, Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.
