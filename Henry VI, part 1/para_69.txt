GLOUCESTER :  I am come to survey the Tower this day: Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance. Where be these warders, that they wait not here? Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.  First Warder  [Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously? First Serving-Man	It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.  Second Warder  [Within]  Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in. First Serving-Man	Villains, answer you so the lord protector?  First Warder  [Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him: We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
