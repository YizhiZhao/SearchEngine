CLARENCE :  Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish. Which of you, if you were a prince's son, Being pent from liberty, as I am now, if two such murderers as yourselves came to you, Would not entreat for life? My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks: O, if thine eye be not a flatterer, Come thou on my side, and entreat for me, As you would beg, were you in my distress A begging prince what beggar pities not?  Second Murderer  Look behind you, my lord.  First Murderer  Take that, and that: if all this will not do, Stabs him I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within. Exit, with the body  Second Murderer  A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd! How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands Of this most grievous guilty murder done! Re-enter First Murderer  First Murderer  How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not? By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!  Second Murderer  I would he knew that I had saved his brother! Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say; For I repent me that the duke is slain. Exit  First Murderer  So do not I: go, coward as thou art. Now must I hide his body in some hole, Until the duke take order for his burial: And when I have my meed, I must away; For this will out, and here I must not stay.
