DUCHESS OF YORK :  Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well: Incapable and shallow innocents, You cannot guess who caused your father's death.  Boy  Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester Told me, the king, provoked by the queen, Devised impeachments to imprison him : And when my uncle told me so, he wept, And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek; Bade me rely on him as on my father, And he would love me dearly as his child.
