QUEEN ELIZABETH :  Give me no help in lamentation; I am not barren to bring forth complaints All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, That I, being govern'd by the watery moon, May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!  Children  Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
