CLARENCE :  Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me; I am his brother, and I love him well. If you be hired for meed, go back again, And I will send you to my brother Gloucester, Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death.  Second Murderer  You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
