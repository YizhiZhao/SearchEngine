KING RICHARD III :  Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death? He striketh him Take that, until thou bring me better news.  Third Messenger  The news I have to tell your majesty Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters, Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd; And he himself wander'd away alone, No man knows whither.
