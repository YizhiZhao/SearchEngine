DUCHESS OF YORK :  [To DORSET] Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee! To LADY ANNE Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee! To QUEEN ELIZABETH Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee! I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me! Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen, And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.
