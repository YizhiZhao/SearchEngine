CLARENCE :  Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings Hath in the tables of his law commanded That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then, Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's? Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands, To hurl upon their heads that break his law.  Second Murderer  And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee, For false forswearing and for murder too: Thou didst receive the holy sacrament, To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.  First Murderer  And, like a traitor to the name of God, Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.  Second Murderer  Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.  First Murderer  How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us, When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
