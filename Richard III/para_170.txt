QUEEN MARGARET :  A little joy enjoys the queen thereof; For I am she, and altogether joyless. I can no longer hold me patient. Advancing Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out In sharing that which you have pill'd from me! Which of you trembles not that looks on me? If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects, Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels? O gentle villain, do not turn away!
