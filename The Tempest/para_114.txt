PROSPERO :  So, slave; hence! Exit CALIBAN Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND following ARIEL'S song. Come unto these yellow sands, And then take hands: Courtsied when you have and kiss'd The wild waves whist, Foot it featly here and there; And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear. Hark, hark! Burthen [dispersedly, within The watch-dogs bark! Burthen Bow-wow Hark, hark! I hear The strain of strutting chanticleer Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
