BRUTUS :  Then follow me, and give me audience, friends. Cassius, go you into the other street, And part the numbers. Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar's death.  First Citizen  I will hear Brutus speak.  Second Citizen  I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons, When severally we hear them rendered. Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit  Third Citizen  The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
