BRUTUS :  Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences enforced, for which he suffered death. Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my country to need my death.  All  Live, Brutus! live, live!  First Citizen  Bring him with triumph home unto his house.  Second Citizen  Give him a statue with his ancestors.  Third Citizen  Let him be Caesar.  Fourth Citizen  Caesar's better parts Shall be crown'd in Brutus.  First Citizen  We'll bring him to his house With shouts and clamours.
