ANTONY :  Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it; It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men; And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you, it will make you mad: 'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs; For, if you should, O, what would come of it!  Fourth Citizen  Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony; You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
