BRUTUS :  Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony: Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony, By our permission, is allow'd to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. Exit  First Citizen  Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.  Third Citizen  Let him go up into the public chair; We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
