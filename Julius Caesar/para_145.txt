BRUTUS :  The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them. Opens the letter and reads 'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself. Shall Rome,  &amp; c. Speak, strike, redress! Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!' Such instigations have been often dropp'd Where I have took them up. 'Shall Rome,  &amp; c.' Thus must I piece it out: Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome? My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king. 'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise: If the redress will follow, thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus! Re-enter LUCIUS
