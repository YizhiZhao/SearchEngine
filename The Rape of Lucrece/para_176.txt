'Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will; How was I overseen that thou shalt see it! My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill; My life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it. Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'So be it:' Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee: Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.'
