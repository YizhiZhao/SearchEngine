Imagine her as one in dead of night From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking, That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite, Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking; What terror or 'tis! but she, in worser taking, From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view The sight which makes supposed terror true.
