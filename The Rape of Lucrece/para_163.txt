'Tis double death to drown in ken of shore; He ten times pines that pines beholding food; To see the salve doth make the wound ache more; Great grief grieves most at that would do it good; Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood, Who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows; Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.
