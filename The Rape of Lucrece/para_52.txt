Now is he come unto the chamber-door, That shuts him from the heaven of his thought, Which with a yielding latch, and with no more, Hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought. So from himself impiety hath wrought, That for his prey to pray he doth begin, As if the heavens should countenance his sin.
