Thus cavils she with every thing she sees: True grief is fond and testy as a child, Who wayward once, his mood with nought agrees: Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild; Continuance tames the one; the other wild, Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still, With too much labour drowns for want of skill.
