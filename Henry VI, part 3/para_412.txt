KING LEWIS XI :  Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself, And sit thee by our side: Seats her by him Yield not thy neck To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind Still ride in triumph over all mischance. Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief; It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
