KING EDWARD IV :  Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence; And once again proclaim us King of England. You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow: Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry, And swell so much the higher by their ebb. Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak. Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course Where peremptory Warwick now remains: The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay, Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.
