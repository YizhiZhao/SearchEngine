KING HENRY VI :  Master lieutenant, now that God and friends Have shaken Edward from the regal seat, And turn'd my captive state to liberty, My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys, At our enlargement what are thy due fees?  Lieutenant  Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns; But if an humble prayer may prevail, I then crave pardon of your majesty.
