KING HENRY VI :  Woe above woe! grief more than common grief! O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds! O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity! The red rose and the white are on his face, The fatal colours of our striving houses: The one his purple blood right well resembles; The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth: Wither one rose, and let the other flourish; If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.  Son  How will my mother for a father's death Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!  Father  How will my wife for slaughter of my son Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
