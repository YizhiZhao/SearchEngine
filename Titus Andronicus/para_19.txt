TITUS ANDRONICUS :  Let it be so; and let Andronicus Make this his latest farewell to their souls. Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb In peace and honour rest you here, my sons; Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest, Secure from worldly chances and mishaps! Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells, Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms, No noise, but silence and eternal sleep: In peace and honour rest you here, my sons! Enter LAVINIA
