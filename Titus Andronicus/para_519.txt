MARCUS ANDRONICUS :  Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house, To Attendants And hither hale that misbelieving Moor, To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death, As punishment for his most wicked life. Exeunt Attendants LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend  All  Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
