DEMETRIUS :  Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?  Young LUCIUS  [Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news, For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you, My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me The goodliest weapons of his armoury To gratify your honourable youth, The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say; And so I do, and with his gifts present Your lordships, that, whenever you have need, You may be armed and appointed well: And so I leave you both: Aside like bloody villains. Exeunt Young LUCIUS, and Attendant
