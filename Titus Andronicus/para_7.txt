SATURNINUS :  Friends, that have been thus forward in my right, I thank you all and here dismiss you all, And to the love and favor of my country Commit myself, my person and the cause. Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS Rome, be as just and gracious unto me As I am confident and kind to thee. Open the gates, and let me in.
