LUCIUS :  Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so, To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe! But, gentle people, give me aim awhile, For nature puts me to a heavy task: Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near, To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk. O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips, Kissing TITUS These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face, The last true duties of thy noble son!
