KING HENRY V :  My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester, Follow Fluellen closely at the heels: The glove which I have given him for a favour May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear; It is the soldier's; I by bargain should Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick: If that the soldier strike him, as I judge By his blunt bearing he will keep his word, Some sudden mischief may arise of it; For I do know Fluellen valiant And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder, And quickly will return an injury: Follow and see there be no harm between them. Go you with me, uncle of Exeter. Exeunt  SCENE VIII. Before KING HENRY'S pavilion.  Enter GOWER and WILLIAMS
