BARDOLPH :  And of women.  Hostess  Nay, that a' did not.  Boy  Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils incarnate.  Hostess  A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he never liked.  Boy  A' said once, the devil would have him about women.  Hostess  A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.  Boy  Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul burning in hell-fire?
