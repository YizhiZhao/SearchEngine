BOURBON :  Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame! Let us die in honour: once more back again; And he that will not follow Bourbon now, Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand, Like a base pander, hold the chamber-door Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog, His fairest daughter is contaminated.  Constable  Disorder, that hath spoil'd us, friend us now! Let us on heaps go offer up our lives.
