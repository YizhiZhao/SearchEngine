CASSIO :  Masters, play here; I will content your pains; Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.' Music Enter Clown  Clown  Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples, that they speak i' the nose thus?  First Musician  How, sir, how!  Clown  Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?  First Musician  Ay, marry, are they, sir.  Clown  O, thereby hangs a tail.  First Musician  Whereby hangs a tale, sir?  Clown  Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know. But, masters, here's money for you: and the general so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's sake, to make no more noise with it.  First Musician  Well, sir, we will not.  Clown  If you have any music that may not be heard, to't again: but, as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care.  First Musician  We have none such, sir.  Clown  Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away: go; vanish into air; away! Exeunt Musicians
