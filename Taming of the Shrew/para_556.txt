PETRUCHIO :  [Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me. Much good do it unto thy gentle heart! Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love, Will we return unto thy father's house And revel it as bravely as the best, With silken coats and caps and golden rings, With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things; With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery, With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery. What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure, To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure. Enter Tailor Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments; Lay forth the gown. Enter Haberdasher What news with you, sir?  Haberdasher  Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
