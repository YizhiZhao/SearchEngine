BIANCA :  [Reads]  ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord, 'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion; 'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord, 'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection: 'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I: 'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.' Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not: Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice, To change true rules for old inventions. Enter a Servant  Servant  Mistress, your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister's chamber up: You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
