BAPTISTA :  A mighty man of Pisa; by report I know him well: you are very welcome, sir, Take you the lute, and you the set of books; You shall go see your pupils presently. Holla, within! Enter a Servant Sirrah, lead these gentlemen To my daughters; and tell them both, These are their tutors: bid them use them well. Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following We will go walk a little in the orchard, And then to dinner. You are passing welcome, And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
