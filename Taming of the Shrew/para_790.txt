PETRUCHIO :  Nay, I will win my wager better yet And show more sign of her obedience, Her new-built virtue and obedience. See where she comes and brings your froward wives As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.

Widow  Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh, Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
