PETRUCHIO :  'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat. What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook? How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser, And serve it thus to me that love it not? Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all; Throws the meat,  &amp; c. about the stage You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves! What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
