CORNWALL :  I have received a hurt: follow me, lady. Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace: Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm. Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN  Second Servant  I'll never care what wickedness I do, If this man come to good.  Third Servant  If she live long, And in the end meet the old course of death, Women will all turn monsters.  Second Servant  Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam To lead him where he would: his roguish madness Allows itself to any thing.  Third Servant  Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him! Exeunt severally
