KING LEAR :  Regan, I think you are; I know what reason I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb, Sepulchring an adultress. To KENT O, are you free? Some other time for that. Beloved Regan, Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here: Points to his heart I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
