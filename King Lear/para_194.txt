KING LEAR :  How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.  Fool  Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool, thou art nothing. To GONERIL Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum, He that keeps nor crust nor crum, Weary of all, shall want some. Pointing to KING LEAR That's a shealed peascod.
