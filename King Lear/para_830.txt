EDMUND :  Come hither, captain; hark. Take thou this note; Giving a paper go follow them to prison: One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men Are as the time is: to be tender-minded Does not become a sword: thy great employment Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't, Or thrive by other means.  Captain  I'll do 't, my lord.
