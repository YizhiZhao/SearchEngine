OSWALD :  Madam, within; but never man so changed. I told him of the army that was landed; He smiled at it: I told him you were coming: His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery, And of the loyal service of his son, When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot, And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out: What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him; What like, offensive.
