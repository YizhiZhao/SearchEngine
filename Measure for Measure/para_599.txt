DUKE VINCENTIO :  Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo. Exit Provost Now will I write letters to Angelo,-- The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents Shall witness to him I am near at home, And that, by great injunctions, I am bound To enter publicly: him I'll desire To meet me at the consecrated fount A league below the city; and from thence, By cold gradation and well-balanced form, We shall proceed with Angelo. Re-enter Provost  Provost  Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
