DUKE VINCENTIO :  Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd Even with the stroke and line of his great justice: He doth with holy abstinence subdue That in himself which he spurs on his power To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous; But this being so, he's just. Knocking within Now are they come. Exit Provost This is a gentle provost: seldom when The steeled gaoler is the friend of men. Knocking within How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes. Re-enter Provost  Provost  There he must stay until the officer Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
