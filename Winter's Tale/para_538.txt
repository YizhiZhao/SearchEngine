PAULINA :  As she lived peerless, So her dead likeness, I do well believe, Excels whatever yet you look'd upon Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare To see the life as lively mock'd as ever Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well. PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue I like your silence, it the more shows off Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege, Comes it not something near?
