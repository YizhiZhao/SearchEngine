AUTOLYCUS :  I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.  Clown  Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.  Shepherd  And so have I, boy.  Clown  So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and called me brother; and then the two kings called my father brother; and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father; and so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.  Shepherd  We may live, son, to shed many more.  Clown  Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are.
