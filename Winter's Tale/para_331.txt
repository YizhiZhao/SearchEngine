POLIXENES :  This is a brave fellow.  Clown  Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?  Servant  He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow; points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to him by the gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.  Clown  Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
