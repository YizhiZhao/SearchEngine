AUTOLYCUS :  Ay, an it like your good worship.  Clown  Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.  Shepherd  You may say it, but not swear it.  Clown  Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it, I'll swear it.  Shepherd  How if it be false, son?  Clown  If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.
