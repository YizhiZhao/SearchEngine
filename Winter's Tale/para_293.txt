AUTOLYCUS :  Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he hath been since an ape-bearer; then a process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.  Clown  Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.
