TOUCHSTONE :  By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.  Second Page  We are for you: sit i' the middle.  First Page  Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only prologues to a bad voice?  Second Page  I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two gipsies on a horse.
