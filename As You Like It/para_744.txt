ROSALIND :  Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon. To SILVIUS I will help you, if I can: To PHEBE I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together. To PHEBE I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be married to-morrow: To ORLANDO I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you shall be married to-morrow: To SILVIUS I will content you, if what pleases you contents you, and you shall be married to-morrow. To ORLANDO As you love Rosalind, meet: To SILVIUS as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman, I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.
