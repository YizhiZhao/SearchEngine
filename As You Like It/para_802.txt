JAQUES :  To him will I : out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learn'd. To DUKE SENIOR You to your former honour I bequeath; Your patience and your virtue well deserves it: To ORLANDO You to a love that your true faith doth merit: To OLIVER You to your land and love and great allies: To SILVIUS You to a long and well-deserved bed: To TOUCHSTONE And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures: I am for other than for dancing measures.
