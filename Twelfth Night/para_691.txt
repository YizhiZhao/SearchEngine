MALVOLIO :  They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to face me out of my wits.  Clown  Advise you what you say; the minister is here. Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore! endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain bibble babble.
