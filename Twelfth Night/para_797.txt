DUKE ORSINO :  Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer. To VIOLA Your master quits you; and for your service done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So far beneath your soft and tender breeding, And since you call'd me master for so long, Here is my hand: you shall from this time be Your master's mistress.
