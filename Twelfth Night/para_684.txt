SIR TOBY BELCH :  To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I would he were, for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber. Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA  Clown  [Singing] 'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin, Tell me how thy lady does.'
