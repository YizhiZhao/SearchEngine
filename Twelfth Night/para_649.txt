SEBASTIAN :  Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow: Let me be clear of thee.  Clown  Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario; nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
