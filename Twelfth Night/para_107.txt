MARIA :  Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best. Exit  Clown  Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus? 'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.' Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO God bless thee, lady!
