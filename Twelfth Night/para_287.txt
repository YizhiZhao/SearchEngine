DUKE ORSINO :  Seek him out, and play the tune the while. Exit CURIO. Music plays Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me; For such as I am all true lovers are, Unstaid and skittish in all motions else, Save in the constant image of the creature That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
