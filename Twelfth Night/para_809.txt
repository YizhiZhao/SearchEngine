Meantime, sweet sister, We will not part from hence. Cesario, come; For so you shall be, while you are a man; But when in other habits you are seen, Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen. Exeunt all, except Clown  Clown  [Sings] When that I was and a little tiny boy, With hey, ho, the wind and the rain, A foolish thing was but a toy, For the rain it raineth every day. But when I came to man's estate, With hey, ho,  &amp; c. 'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate, For the rain,  &amp; c. But when I came, alas! to wive, With hey, ho,  &amp; c. By swaggering could I never thrive, For the rain,  &amp; c. But when I came unto my beds, With hey, ho,  &amp; c. With toss-pots still had drunken heads, For the rain,  &amp; c. A great while ago the world begun, With hey, ho,  &amp; c. But that's all one, our play is done, And we'll strive to please you every day. Exit
