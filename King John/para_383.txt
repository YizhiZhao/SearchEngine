ARTHUR :  The wall is high, and yet will I leap down: Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not! There's few or none do know me: if they did, This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite. I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it. If I get down, and do not break my limbs, I'll find a thousand shifts to get away: As good to die and go, as die and stay. Leaps down O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones: Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones! Dies Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT
