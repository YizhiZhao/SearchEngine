KING JOHN :  In us, that are our own great deputy And bear possession of our person here, Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.  First Citizen  A greater power then we denies all this; And till it be undoubted, we do lock Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates; King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved, Be by some certain king purged and deposed.
