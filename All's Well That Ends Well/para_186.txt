COUNTESS :  Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and 'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.  Clown  I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord, sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
