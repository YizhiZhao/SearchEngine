BERTRAM :  Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto?  Second Lord  None in the world; but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.  First Lord  We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night.  Second Lord  I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
