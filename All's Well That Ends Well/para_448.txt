ACT IV : SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.  Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush  Second Lord  He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. When you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will: though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter.  First Soldier  Good captain, let me be the interpreter.  Second Lord  Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?  First Soldier  No, sir, I warrant you.  Second Lord  But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?  First Soldier  E'en such as you speak to me.  Second Lord  He must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language, gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch, ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. Enter PAROLLES
