KING :  Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell: Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received, And is enough for both.  First Lord  'Tis our hope, sir, After well enter'd soldiers, to return And find your grace in health.
