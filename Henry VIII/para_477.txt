GARDINER :  Yes.  Keeper  My lord archbishop; And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.  Chancellor  Let him come in.  Keeper  Your grace may enter now. CRANMER enters and approaches the council-table  Chancellor  My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry To sit here at this present, and behold That chair stand empty: but we all are men, In our own natures frail, and capable Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us, Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little, Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains, For so we are inform'd, with new opinions, Divers and dangerous; which are heresies, And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.
