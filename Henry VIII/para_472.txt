KING HENRY VIII :  Ha! 'tis he, indeed: Is this the honour they do one another? 'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought They had parted so much honesty among 'em At least, good manners, as not thus to suffer A man of his place, and so near our favour, To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures, And at the door too, like a post with packets. By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery: Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close: We shall hear more anon. Exeunt  SCENE III. The Council-Chamber.  Enter Chancellor; places himself at the upper end  of the table on the left hand; a seat being left  void above him, as for CRANMER's seat.

Keeper at the door  Chancellor  Speak to the business, master-secretary: Why are we met in council?
