QUEEN KATHARINE :  Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye And all such false professors! would you have me-- If you have any justice, any pity; If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits-- Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me? Alas, has banish'd me his bed already, His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords, And all the fellowship I hold now with him Is only my obedience. What can happen To me above this wretchedness? all your studies Make me a curse like this.
