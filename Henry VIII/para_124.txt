CARDINAL WOLSEY :  What warlike voice, And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not; By all the laws of war you're privileged. Re-enter Servant  Chamberlain  How now! what is't?  Servant  A noble troop of strangers; For so they seem: they've left their barge and landed; And hither make, as great ambassadors From foreign princes.
