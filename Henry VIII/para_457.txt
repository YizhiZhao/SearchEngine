KING HENRY VIII :  Be of good cheer; They shall no more prevail than we give way to. Keep comfort to you; and this morning see You do appear before them: if they shall chance, In charging you with matters, to commit you, The best persuasions to the contrary Fail not to use, and with what vehemency The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties Will render you no remedy, this ring Deliver them, and your appeal to us There make before them. Look, the good man weeps! He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother! I swear he is true--hearted; and a soul None better in my kingdom. Get you gone, And do as I have bid you. Exit CRANMER He has strangled His language in his tears. Enter Old Lady, LOVELL following  Gentleman  [Within]                 Come back: what mean you?  Old Lady  I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person Under their blessed wings!
