KING HENRY VIII :  'Tis well said again; And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well: And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you: His said he did; and with his deed did crown His word upon you. Since I had my office, I have kept you next my heart; have not alone Employ'd you where high profits might come home, But pared my present havings, to bestow My bounties upon you.
