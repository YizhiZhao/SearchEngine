SANDS :  The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going, For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now An honest country lord, as I am, beaten A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady, Held current music too.  Chamberlain  Well said, Lord Sands; Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.
