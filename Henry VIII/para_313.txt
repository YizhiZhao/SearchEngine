KING HENRY VIII :  It may well be; There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning Papers of state he sent me to peruse, As I required: and wot you what I found There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly? Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing; The several parcels of his plate, his treasure, Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks Possession of a subject.
