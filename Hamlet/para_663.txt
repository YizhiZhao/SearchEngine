HAMLET :  Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command? O, say!  Ghost  Do not forget: this visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But, look, amazement on thy mother sits: O, step between her and her fighting soul: Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works: Speak to her, Hamlet.
