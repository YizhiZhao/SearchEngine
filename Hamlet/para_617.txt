HAMLET :  By and by is easily said. Exit POLONIUS Leave me, friends. Exeunt all but HAMLET Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on.

Exit  SCENE III. A room in the castle.  Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
