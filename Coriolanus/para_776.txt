AUFIDIUS :  There was it: For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him. At a few drops of women's rheum, which are As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour Of our great action: therefore shall he die, And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark! Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People  First Conspirator  Your native town you enter'd like a post, And had no welcomes home: but he returns, Splitting the air with noise.  Second Conspirator  And patient fools, Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear With giving him glory.  Third Conspirator  Therefore, at your vantage, Ere he express himself, or move the people With what he would say, let him feel your sword, Which we will second. When he lies along, After your way his tale pronounced shall bury His reasons with his body.
