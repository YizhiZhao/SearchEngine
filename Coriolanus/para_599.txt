CORIOLANUS :  Thank you, sir: farewell. Exit Citizen O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn, Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart, Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise, Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love Unseparable, shall within this hour, On a dissension of a doit, break out To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes, Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep, To take the one the other, by some chance, Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends And interjoin their issues. So with me: My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me, He does fair justice; if he give me way, I'll do his country service. Exit  SCENE V. The same. A hall in Aufidius's house.  Music within. Enter a Servingman  First Servingman  Wine, wine, wine! What service is here! I think our fellows are asleep. Exit Enter a second Servingman  Second Servingman  Where's Cotus? my master calls for him. Cotus! Exit Enter CORIOLANUS
