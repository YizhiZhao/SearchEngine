SICINIUS :  He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law, And therefore law shall scorn him further trial Than the severity of the public power Which he so sets at nought.  First Citizen  He shall well know The noble tribunes are the people's mouths, And we their hands.  Citizens  He shall, sure on't.
