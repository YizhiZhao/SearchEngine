BRUTUS :  We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.  Second Citizen  Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice, He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.  Third Citizen  Certainly He flouted us downright.  First Citizen  No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.  Second Citizen  Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
