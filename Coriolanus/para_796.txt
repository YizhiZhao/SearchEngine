AUFIDIUS :  My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage, Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours To call me to your senate, I'll deliver Myself your loyal servant, or endure Your heaviest censure.  First Lord  Bear from hence his body; And mourn you for him: let him be regarded As the most noble corse that ever herald Did follow to his urn.  Second Lord  His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame. Let's make the best of it.
