MARCIUS :  Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours. Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work, That we with smoking swords may march from hence, To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast. They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?  First Senator  No, nor a man that fears you less than he, That's lesser than a little. Drums afar off Hark! our drums Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls, Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates, Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes; They'll open of themselves. Alarum afar off Hark you. far off! There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes Amongst your cloven army.
